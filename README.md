# Pokémon Radiant Red v0.1

This is based on [**Pokémon Red++**][rpp-backup]

Radiant Red serves as an updated version of Pokémon Red.

It fixes a lot of bugs leftover from original Red and Blue, as well as adding new features.

# You can download IPS patch files [**here**](patches/). Apply them to a normal Red Version rom. Just apply whichever patch you want.

The source code builds two versions, a "Normal" version and a "Hard" version. The only difference is the level curve.
"pokered.gbc" is the Normal version, "pokeblue.gbc" is the Hard version. There is also the option to build either version with snowy graphics.

A: The house between Fuchsia City's Gym and Pokémon Center.

### Q: Where is the Move Relearner?
A: Same house as the Move Deleter.

### Q: Where do I find Shiny Pokémon?
A: The only "Event Shiny" for now is the Magikarp you buy in the Mt. Moon Pokécenter, but all other Pokémon have the same chance to be shiny as in [**Polished Crystal v2**][polished]. Also, breeding at the Daycare is slightly more likely, due to the Day Care Man's Ditto being shiny.

### Q: Will you add so-and-so feature?
A: Maybe!

## Setting up your own version

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md). This way you can build the latest dev version for yourself, or use it as a starting point for your own hack.
