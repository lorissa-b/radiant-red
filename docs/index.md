# Radiant Red

Radiant Red is a Pokemon Red hack, heavily based off of [Red++](https://github.com/TheFakeMateo/rpp-backup) by TheFakeMateo. It adds the missing types to Generation 1, adds new moves from all existing types (except Normal), and updates the movesets of every single Generation 1 Pokemon to actually make them viable! Each of the 151 Kanto Pokemon is catchable in the game.

## Notable Features
- Play as Red or Leaf - the female protagonist from Fire Red and Leaf Green
- Headbutt trees to shake down Pokemon
- Use field moves from the map, not your Pokemon menu
- Take on the eight gyms and the Elite Four, complete with updated rosters
