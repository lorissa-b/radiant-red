## A Revamp of Pokemon Red
Based on [Pokemon Red++](https://github.com/TheFakeMateo/rpp-backup), Radiant Red strives to be an improved version of Generation 1 Kanto. New moves, new types, new Pokemon learnsets, and new gym rosters will help make Kanto come alive again, while still keeping familiar Gen 1 mechanics.

### Missing Types
Steel, Dark, and Fairy types have been added back into the game!

### New Learnsets
Pokemon learned terrible moves in generation 1. Now they've been updated to make more Pokemon viable!

### New Gym Rosters
Every gym leader and Elite Four member has been given a new roster, to account for the weaknesses of their type or theme!

### New Moves
A selection of generation 7 moves from across the types has been added, with an emphasis on types lacking variety in generation 1!
